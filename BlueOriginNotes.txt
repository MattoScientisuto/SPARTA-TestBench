        <power>:

        PARAMETERS
        1. select channel number (i think this would be C1, C2, etc)
        2. reset OR manual mode : determines if a power channel will automatically re-enable pwer output if
        - power channel output command remains enabled
        - a delay of 100ms has elapsed since its most recent over-current event
        - the sensed current draw on the power channel is within the allowable limit
        - # of current limit trip events while the power channel output command has remained enabled is less than 5
        3. limit: max amps (0.0 to 2.0)


        <stream>:
        Used for passing character values over stream connection (IPC, Arduino, Laptop)
         - RS-232
         - Serial (This probably would've been ideal but we're using ethernet)
         - Ethernet (TCP, UDP)

         PARAMETERS
         1. type: serial, tcp, udp 
         2. name
         3. ip : this should be the MicroPC's static ip address
          - I'm assuming this is the static ip we set through the Windows control panel (test using socket listener)
         4. port : we'll just say 50155 , apparently this can just be anything free that doesn't interfere with standard/common ports


    <action>


        <message>
        We'll use this to send indicator messages for the Python socket listener to receive and interpret
         - this will allow us to distribute conditional commands for each component to run at specific flight conditions
